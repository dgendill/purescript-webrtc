# purescript-webrtc

This repo is a fork of puffnfresh/purescript-webrtc which I made so many
changes too, I can't justify making a PR.  Also, I've only tested this in
the context of data channels, so I have no idea how it works with audio and
video.

I'll tag this for my own project and keep it around in case someone else
finds it helpful.
